## **SUMMARY:**
The app gives users the option to get data about their current location (or any other).  This will include
weather, local time, sunrise and sunset times, and current temperature, plus the address and city and state.  If desired,
the user can click to generate markers and info windows for nearby points of interest.  Each info window should allow a Google
search on the location selected.

Note that because of the way the API works, the points of interest may not generate for remote locations.  The user will have
better success when searching in populous or prominent places (e.g., cities).

## **TECHNOLOGIES USED:**
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- jQuery
- Google Maps APIs: Geocode, TimeZone, and Places
- Open Weather API
